        Airbnb is a popular online marketplace that connects people who want to
        rent out their properties with travelers looking for accommodations.
        <br />
        It was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan
        Blecharczyk and has since grown into a global platform with listings in
        over <br />
        100,000 cities and 191 countries. Users can rent anything from a spare
        room to an entire house or apartment for short-term stays.

      <p>
        This code is similar to the previous example but organized as a
        standalone app component named BackgroundChangerApp. <br />
        It renders a heading, a paragraph explaining how to use the app, and a
        button to change the background color. When the button is clicked,<br />
        it triggers the handleChangeColor function to update the background
        color.

        This is a basic implementation of a Blackjack game in React. You can
        extend it by adding game logic for player and dealer actions,<br />
        implementing card values and scoring, handling game outcomes, and
        styling the UI.
